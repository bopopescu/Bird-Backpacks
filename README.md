As birds migrate south each winter, they can be difficult to track, especially in extreme climates. Our product, Bird Backpacks provides a cheap, simple way to monitor migratory birds by using light-level geolocators with an Arduino Uno and ATTiny microcontroller, then sending serial values to a Raspberry Pi which pushes data to the cloud (GCP), and uses deep learning to predict their possible locations.
